# FunkyFridayBot
### Features: 
- Can handle tons of notes at once and can react and hit notes far faster than possible than humans

### Limitations:
- Cannot hold notes
- Can only be used on the right side with downscroll
- Uses lots of system resources because it constantly captures each note separately

### How to use:
To run this bot, you need to have python installed

You need to install the required packages for the bot which are `mss`, `pillow` and `pyautogui`

The command to install all of these packages is 
```
pip install mss Pillow pyautogui
```
Once these packages are installed, open a terminal in the folder and run the bot with
```
python3 main.py
```
